        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Homemade chili is delicious and goes great with cornbread or over corn chips for a chili pie! I like to use spicy pinto beans.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beef</strong>: The recipe starts with a pound of ground beef. You can use ground turkey if you prefer.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion</strong>: Cooking a chopped onion with the ground meat adds tons of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Canned goods</strong>: You'll need a can of tomato sauce, a can of stewed tomatoes, and a can of kidney beans.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices</strong>: This homemade chili is spiced with chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place ground beef and onion in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until meat is browned and onion is tender, about 5 to 7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in tomato sauce, kidney beans, stewed tomatoes with juice, and water. Season with chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
